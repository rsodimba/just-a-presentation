Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

Legacy System Assessment & Modernization Strategy: Conducted an in-depth evaluation of the existing legacy systems and defined a comprehensive roadmap for migrating to a cloud-native, microservices-based architecture. Collaborated with senior stakeholders to align the transformation strategy with business objectives, budget, and timelines.

Cloud Migration & Infrastructure Modernization: Spearheaded the migration of core systems to a scalable cloud platform, enabling the telecom to leverage elastic infrastructure for handling increasing customer demand. Introduced containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) and implemented automation tools to enhance system agility and reduce operational overhead.

Modernized Technology Stack Implementation: Transitioned from monolithic legacy applications to a modular, API-driven architecture that utilized modern technologies such as microservices, serverless computing, and DevOps practices. The new tech stack included cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, and introduced technologies like CI/CD pipelines for faster, more reliable deployments.

Customer Experience Enhancement: Improved customer-facing services by integrating advanced analytics and AI/ML capabilities into the new technology stack, enabling personalized service offerings, predictive maintenance, and enhanced digital engagement. This resulted in a significant improvement in customer satisfaction and retention rates.

Operational Efficiency Gains: Implemented automation across key processes, reducing manual interventions and increasing operational efficiency by over 30%. Introduced real-time monitoring and analytics tools to proactively address system performance and reliability.

Data Migration & Compliance: Successfully migrated large volumes of sensitive customer and operational data from legacy systems to the new stack, ensuring full compliance with Singaporeâ€™s data privacy regulations. Implemented robust data governance frameworks to ensure ongoing compliance and security.

Cross-Functional Team Leadership: Led a cross-functional team of developers, cloud architects, system integrators, and third-party vendors to ensure the smooth execution of the transformation plan. Fostered strong collaboration between technical and business teams to align technology initiatives with strategic goals.

Risk Management & Mitigation: Identified potential risks throughout the transition process, particularly concerning system downtime, data integrity, and customer impact. Developed and executed a risk management framework to mitigate disruptions during migration, ensuring minimal impact on business operations.

Post-Implementation Support & Optimization: Oversaw post-deployment support to stabilize the new systems, and introduced continuous improvement processes. Conducted performance tuning and optimization initiatives, resulting in a 25% reduction in system downtime and a more reliable service delivery platform.

Impact & Results:

Reduced system downtime by 40% and improved service availability.
Increased operational efficiency by 30% through automation and streamlined processes.
Enhanced customer satisfaction through improved digital services and personalized experiences.
Enabled future scalability and innovation with the adoption of a cloud-native, microservices architecture.
Met all compliance and regulatory requirements, ensuring a secure and sustainable technology environment.
